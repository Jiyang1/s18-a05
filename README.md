# Assignment 5: Introduction to Pandas

In this assignment you will use the pandas library to explore crime data from the Chicago data portal.

First you'll need to download the dataset. Start by visiting the [data portal page](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data). The full dataset is very large so we will just work with the year 2017. To subset it click on Filter and set ["Year is 2017"](filter.png). Download the data as a CSV by clicking "Export" > "CSV" and save it to your assignment directory. It should be about 61mb and 266k rows (use `ls -oh` and `wc -l` at the command line to quickly check).
